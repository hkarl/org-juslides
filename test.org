#+TITLE: A test presentation for Jupyter 
#+SUBTITLE: And a nice subtitle 
#+OPTIONS: tags:nil
#+LANGUAGE: en

** Setup							  :skipslide:

Main point here is to set up warnings properly for presentation and to
load tutormagic, so that we can later on use pythontutor for code
animations. 
   
#+BEGIN_SRC  Python 
%load_ext tutormagic
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=DeprecationWarning, module='.*/IPython/.*')
#+END_SRC

* Ordinary markup 

** Slide with normal markup  

We can start a slide with some text 

Itemized lists work as expected 

- List item 
  - A sub item 
- and some 
- more list entries  
  - with more sub entries
  - the curse of Powerpoint! 

** Font markup 


- With *bold* text
- and /empahizsed/ text
- and */and both/* 
- as well as font for code: ~stuff in fixed font~ 

** Other markup 

- Other markup should work as expected 
- Especially, LaTeX markup
  - $x = \sin(x)$
  - $k = \sum_{i=0}^n i^2$
- External links
  - Platin: http://www.python.org
  - With description: [[http://www.python.org][Python rules]]


* Subtitles and basic animations 

** A slide with subtitles 

Some text 

*** A subtitle

Some more text 

** A slide with animations 

- Subtitles can act as "click points" 
- Just give them a tag animate 

*** This shows up with a click					    :animate:

- There we are! 

** Animations in text 

- Animating list elements does not yet work 
- But would be nice
- On the TODO list 
- Idea is something like this: 
  - bla
#+ANIMATE:
- bla1 
- bl2


* Source code 
  
** Ordinary source code 

#+BEGIN_SRC pyhton 
x = [1,2, 3, 6, 7, 8]
for xx in x:
    print (x)
#+END_SRC


** Animated source code 

We can show source code only with a click 

#+ATTR_JUSLIDES: :animate t 
#+CAPTION: This is a source code caption 
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  x = [5, 7, 19]
  for xx in x:
      y = xx
      print (y)
#+END_SRC



** Even two source blocks on one slide 


#+CAPTION: This is a source code caption 
#+BEGIN_SRC python :exports both 
  x = [5, 7, 19]
  for xx in x:
      y = xx
      print (y)
#+END_SRC


#+ATTR_JUSLIDES: :animate t 
#+BEGIN_SRC python
x = 17
x = 3*x
print(x)
#+END_SRC


** And source code linking to pythontutor 

Perhaps the raison d'Ãªtre for this backend: Source code with
Pythontutor! 

#+ATTR_JUSLIDES: :animate t
#+CAPTION: This is a source code with pyhtontutor 
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  %%tutor --lang python3
  x = [5, 7, 19]
  for xx in x:
      y = xx
      print (y)
#+END_SRC




** And a Java example 

#+BEGIN_SRC java 
public static void main 

#+END_SRC

** And a C example 

#+BEGIN_SRC C

  int main () {
    return -1;
  }
#+END_SRC

* Includes and excludes 


** Goal 

- Easily keep text in the ORG file to be shown in (e.g.) LaTeX output 
- But not on slides 
- And possible vice versa 

** Approach 

- Provide three tags
  - ~:dropslide:~ to drop a slide entirely from the generate notebook
  - ~:skipslide:~ to keep it in the notebook, but assign the "skip"
    property to it
  - ~:nolatex:~ to keep it in notebook but drop from LaTeX output 

~:noexport:~ retains its usual meaning: Export nowhere. 



** Not in notebook 						  :dropslide:

- This slide should not appear in the generated notebook 
- But in the notmal output like LaTeX

** In notebook, but not shown in a presentation			  :skipslide:

- This will not show up 

*** Subtitles on skipped slide 

- This should not appear, either 
- Thanks to tag inheritance in org-mode's export backends! 

** Again on slide 

And another slide, back on all outputs 



** Notes are exported 						      :notes:

Notes slides: great for lot's of text. Also not shown in
presentation. (Difference to skip not yet clear to me?) 

Pellentesque dapibus suscipit ligula.  Donec posuere augue in quam.
Etiam vel tortor sodales tellus ultricies commodo.  Suspendisse
potenti.  Aenean in sem ac leo mollis blandit.  Donec neque quam,
dignissim in, mollis nec, sagittis eu, wisi.  Phasellus lacus.  Etiam
laoreet quam sed arcu.  Phasellus at dui in ligula mollis ultricies.
Integer placerat tristique nisl.  Praesent augue.  Fusce commodo.
Vestibulum convallis, lorem a tempus semper, dui dui euismod elit,
vitae placerat urna tortor vitae lacus.  Nullam libero mauris,
consequat quis, varius et, dictum id, arcu.  Mauris mollis tincidunt
felis.  Aliquam feugiat tellus ut neque.  Nulla facilisis, risus a
rhoncus fermentum, tellus tellus lacinia purus, et dictum nunc justo
sit amet elit.


** Ordinary slide 

Just some ordinary slide in the middle to test export suppression 

** And only on slide						   :nolatex:

This slide will be suppressed in LaTeX  because of nolatex . 

- Fusce sagittis, libero non molestie mollis,
- magna orci ultrices dolor,
- at vulputate neque nulla lacinia eros.

** Nowhere							   :noexport:

This slide appears nowhere 

** Normal slide in this section 

- Just to show this will show up again 
- More text here 


* Subslides 

** A normal slide 

- RISE has a notion of subslides 
- Will be display as a "vertical extension" of the main narrative
  track 
- Just give a tag ~:subslide:~ to a slide heading 

** A subslide							   :subslide:

- d
- c

** Another subslide						   :subslide:

- f
- e 
- g

** And a normal slide 

- This slide is back in the ordinary track 
- h 
- i 


* Tables, Images, ... 

** A slide with a table 

| Kind | Data | Value |
|------+------+-------|
| x    | y    | z     |
| a    | b    | c     |


** A slide with an image 

This should be an image from a file 

#+CAPTION: A figure caption 
#+NAME: fig:test-image
[[./figures/upb.png]]


** Tikz test 

A normal link to some website  [[http://www.heise.de][Heise]] 

#+header: :imagemagick yes :iminoptions -density 600 :imoutoptions -geometry 200 
#+header: :cache yes
#+begin_src latex :exports results :results output raw :file figures/tikz.png :fit t

      [circle, draw, fill=blue!30] {2} child { node [circle, draw,
        fill=green!30] {3} } child { node [circle, draw,

  \end{tikzpicture}
#+end_src

The tikz result should be visible in Figure [[tikzfigure]]. 



* Experimental markup 

** Slido links 

TODO


** Dot files 
#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file dot_success.png
  digraph {
  // graph from left to right
  rankdir=LR;
  splines=true;
  node [shape=box];
 
  id [label="Install Graphviz"]
  conf [label="Configure org-babel"]
  dot [label="DOT in org-mode"]
 
  id -> conf
  conf -> dot
  dot -> "Profit"
  dot -> "Success" [style=dotted]
  }
#+END_SRC


#+RESULTS:
[[file:dot_success.png]]
